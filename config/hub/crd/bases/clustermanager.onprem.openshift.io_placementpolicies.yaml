        tuple to be produced by different PlacementPolicies. Access control inside
        the hub is uniform, so if a user has the power to create a PlacementPolicy,
        he can put ANY MultiClusterWorkload on any RegisteredCluster.  However, he
        cannot control the CONTENT of that MultiClusterWorkload unless he has the
        power to "use" the "asUser" in that MultiClusterWorkload.
